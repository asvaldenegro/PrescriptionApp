# PrescriptionApp
Java app that handles a collection of prescriptions and their side effects.  This was a project in my first Object Oriented Programming course.  It has log in capability provided the Authentication Server is running.  There are also JUnit Tests for server and client side  functions.  In addition to that, the entire project makes use of the layered architecture.
